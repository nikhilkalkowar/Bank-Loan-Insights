Advanced Bank Loan Data Analysis | Power BI Project

Project Overview
The Advanced Bank Loan Data Analysis project leverages Power BI to transform raw loan data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making. Traditional reporting methods often lack depth and interactivity, limiting the ability to analyze borrower behavior, loan performance, and lending trends effectively. This project aims to fill that gap by creating dynamic and interconnected dashboards that provide a comprehensive view of lending operations, borrower demographics, and financial metrics.

The dashboards are designed to empower decision-makers with clear, data-driven insights that improve financial planning, risk assessment, and overall operational efficiency.

Problem Statement:
Traditional loan reporting methods often lack interactivity and depth, making it challenging to extract meaningful insights for decision-making. This project addresses the need for a holistic, interactive dashboard system to analyze lending patterns, borrower behavior, and loan performance.

Objectives:
Develop interconnected dashboards that provide dynamic insights into loan data.
Monitor critical KPIs such as total applications, funded amounts, received amounts, average interest rate, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI).
Enable segmentation of loans into "Good" and "Bad" categories and detailed status analysis.
Facilitate strategic decisions through interactive visualizations of trends, borrower demographics, loan purposes, and home ownershi

Dashboards:
Executive Summary
Provides a high-level view of key metrics including total loan applications, funded amount, received amount, average interest rate, and average DTI.
Highlights the proportion of good vs bad loans and detailed loan status for decision support.

Trends & Overview
Interactive visualizations to analyze monthly trends, regional distributions, loan terms, employment length, loan purposes, and home ownership.
Enables pattern recognition and identification of opportunities in lending operations.

Detailed Insights
Deep dive into loan-level data with a comprehensive grid showing purpose, funded amount, interest rate, installment, received amount, and borrower information.
Supports granular analysis and informed decision-making.
